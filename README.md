# OpenAI Image Manipulation using CLIP

This code demonstrates how to perform image manipulation using the OpenAI CLIP model. The CLIP model is a deep learning model that can understand and generate textual descriptions of images. It combines the power of computer vision and natural language processing to enable various image manipulation tasks.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

4. Obtain an OpenAI API key. Sign up on the OpenAI website and obtain your API key.

## Running the Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

2. Update the `openai.api_key` variable in the code with your own OpenAI API key.

3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```shell
   python image_manipulation.py
   ```

4. The script will prompt you to enter a prompt for image manipulation. Provide a textual prompt based on the desired manipulation you want to perform on the image.

5. The script will use the CLIP model to generate a manipulated image based on the provided prompt.

6. The manipulated image will be displayed using the default image viewer on your system.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:
- requests
- numpy
- Pillow (PIL)
- openai

You can install these dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**Note:** This code uses the OpenAI CLIP model and requires a valid API key to interact with the OpenAI API. Ensure that you have a stable internet connection and your API key is properly configured in the code.

Feel free to customize the script and experiment with different prompts to generate various image manipulations using the OpenAI CLIP model. Enjoy exploring the creative possibilities of image manipulation with AI!
